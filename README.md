- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lastpulse
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in engineering software for millwork and cabinet construction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Autodesk Inventor with Woodwork For Inventor.

I'm very interested in learning how to use the iLogic language to automate mundane tasks with programming.
